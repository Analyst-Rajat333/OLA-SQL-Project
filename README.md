# 🚖 Ola SQL Project

This project explores a *ride-sharing dataset* using *Advanced SQL Queries* to generate insights related to customers, bookings, cancellations, ratings, and vehicle types. The aim is to uncover *Actionable Business Intelligence* such as most frequent riders, average ride distances, customer satisfaction levels, and more.
